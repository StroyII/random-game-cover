# Random video game cover
A little Python program i made to have a new game cover image each day. The image can be used for anything like a README file or a website.

The cover update itself each day at 8h UTC

Highly inspired by @Yougo-rgb and his <a href="https://github.com/Yougo-rgb/random-code-error">random coding error</a>
